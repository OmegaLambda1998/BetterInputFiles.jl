# InputFiles.jl Documentation

Provides consistent methods to load in input files, such as `.toml`, `.yaml`, and `.json` files. Also extends the functionality of these files, via pre-processing, post-processing, and macros.

Already using in many of my projects, including [IABCosmo.jl](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/IABCosmo.jl), [SALTJacobian.jl](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/SALTJacobian.jl), [Supernovae.jl](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Supernovae.jl), [ShockCooling.jl](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/ShockCooling.jl), and [Greed.jl](https://github.com/OmegaLambda1998/Greed.jl) (amongst others).
